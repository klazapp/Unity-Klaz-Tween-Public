# Tween Utility for Unity

## Introduction
The `Tween` utility, part of the `com.Klazapp.Utility` namespace, refers to a technique used in animation and game development to create smooth transitions or animations between different states or values over time. The term "Tween" is short for "in-betweening," which involves generating intermediate frames or values between keyframes to create fluid motion or transitions.

## Features
- Tweens allow for smooth transitions between different states or values, such as position, scale, rotation, alpha, and color.
- Tweens are often used to animate UI elements, providing visual feedback and enhancing user experience in applications and games.
- Tweens are commonly used to create animation effects, such as fading in/out, sliding, scaling, and rotating objects.
